                <p><strong>Title: Duality of Mining Problems</strong><br>
                    <strong>Abstract:</strong> Frequent-itemset mining and erasable-itemset mining are two commonly seen and practicaltechniques for finding different useful itemsets in data mining. Frequent-itemset mining is asignificant pre-processing step in the search for association rules and is mainly conducted basedon the frequencies of the itemsets in a transaction database. On the other hand, erasable-itemsetmining is often applied to product production planning and identifies the itemsets that would notsignificantly impact production profits if removed. Although the two mining techniques seem tobe different and independent, we have derived they are actually equivalent to each other. Weformally prove that these two mining techniques possess the property of duality. We designmethods to transform one of the two mining problems into the other and then solve it, and viceversa. The mining results with and without the transformation will be identical. We then extendthe duality property of the two mining problems to multiple-threshold and weighted-itemsituations. With the duality property, we can easily design an algorithm from its correspondingone in the dual mining proble</p>
